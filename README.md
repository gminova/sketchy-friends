### Main goals

- [x] Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- [x] Query an API (e.g. the Github API)
- [x] Populate the UI with API data
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity (e.g. A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars, or: A button to add more users to your collection)
- [x] Have integration tests using React Testing Library

Stretch goals
- [x] Save drawing as pgn (right click, Save As .png)
- [ ] ...see a 10:00 timer at the bottom before the image disappears
- [ ] Save your state to localStorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- [ ] Have a Clear and Undo buttons for the canvas
- [ ] Download image button
### Selected idea: Drawing board
#### User stories

*As a user I want to...*
- [x] ...input a search term 
(photo-size / github url)
- [x] ...be returned an image matching this search term (https://picsum.photos/200/300)
- [x] ...be able to draw the image on a canvas
